# projects

This is a repository holding the majority of my projects, partially so I can access them remotely, and also so employers can see them. This includes most of my programs but isn't entirely up to date at present.
Most of these projects were done for my classes, though there are a few done for Project Euler out of interest as well as others done for fun.
