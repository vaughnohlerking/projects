This is a website I made for my cloud computing and distributed web services class.
The server is no longer running so opening the html files and clicking their links won't lead anywhere, but all of the code is there.
I ran the server on two amazon ec2 instances. One for static content and one for dynamic. The server was run using apache and tomcat,
and for the database I used mySQL
